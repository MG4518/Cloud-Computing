# 📊 Repository Insights
This repository isn’t just a collection of notes — it's a comprehensive resource for learning, teaching, and revising Cloud Computing concepts in an organized, professional format.

Cloud Computing is a modern approach to delivering computing services over the internet. These services include servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—all accessible on-demand from anywhere in the world.

Instead of owning and maintaining physical infrastructure, users can rent computing resources from cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This model offers flexibility, scalability, cost-efficiency, and accessibility.

🔹 Key Characteristics
On-demand self-service
